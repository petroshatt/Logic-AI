# Logical-Entailment-AI
Project 2 for Artificial Intelligence course, written in Python. Implementation of an agent-based model where the agent has an inference mechanism using the two algorithms:
1. Resolution
2. GSAT

The agent is able to conclude if a literal is logically entailed by the knowledge base.
